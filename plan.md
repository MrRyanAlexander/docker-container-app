# Build Plan: Per-User Containerized App with Next.js, Auth0, Kubernetes, and Traefik

## Overview
This document is a complete, step-by-step guide to building a modern, secure, and scalable web application where each authenticated user receives their own isolated Docker container environment. The stack includes:
- **Next.js** for the frontend and public routes
- **Auth0** for authentication
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- **Traefik** for routing and SSL
- **Docker** for per-user isolated environments
- **Cloudflare** for DDoS protection

The app will serve public pages statelessly and securely, and provide each user with a personal, persistent, and isolated environment (e.g., a dev workspace) after login.

---

## Phase 1: Project Initialization & Structure

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Create a root directory, e.g., `per-user-app/`
   - Inside, create:
     - `frontend/` (Next.js app)
     - `kubernetes/` (K8s manifests)
     - `helm/` (Helm charts)
     - `traefik/` (Traefik config)
     - `docker-compose.yml` (for local dev)

2. **Initialize Next.js App**
   - Run: `npx create-next-app@latest frontend --typescript --tailwind --eslint`

3. **Initialize Git Repository**
   - Run: `git init`
   - Add a comprehensive `.gitignore` (Node, Docker, env files, editors, etc.)
   - Make initial commit

4. **Development Environment Requirements**
   - Node.js (LTS)
   - Docker Desktop (with Compose)
   - kubectl, Helm (for K8s)
   - Recommended: VS Code, Git, and Docker extensions

---

## Phase 2: Authentication & User Management

1. **Set Up Auth0**
   - Create an Auth0 tenant and application
   - Configure callback URLs for local and production
   - Store Auth0 credentials in environment variables

2. **Integrate Auth0 with Next.js**
   - Install `@auth0/auth0-react` and `next-auth`
   - Implement `Auth0Provider` in `frontend/pages/_app.tsx`
   - Create login, register, and logout flows
   - Protect authenticated routes (e.g., `/dashboard`)

3. **User Session Management**
   - Use NextAuth.js for session handling
   - Store user metadata (id, email, etc.) in session

---

## Phase 3: Public Pages & Routing

1. **Implement Public Pages**
   - `/` (Landing page with login/register buttons)
   - `/login` (Login form)
   - `/register` (Signup form)
   - `/tos`, `/privacy`, `/forgot-password` (static info pages)

2. **Configure Next.js Routing**
   - Use file-based routing for all public and auth pages
   - Ensure public pages are stateless and do not spawn containers

---

## Phase 4: Per-User Container Management

1. **Container Service Implementation**
   - Create a Node.js service (or Next.js API route) to manage Docker containers
   - Use `dockerode` to interact with Docker/Kubernetes
   - Implement logic to:
     - Check if a user container exists
     - Create a new container for a user if needed
     - Destroy/stop container on logout or after inactivity
     - Assign unique ports and names per user

2. **Container Resource Management**
   - **Resource Limits:**
     - Set CPU/memory limits for user containers (e.g., 0.5 CPU, 512Mi RAM)
     - Example (Kubernetes):
       ```yaml
       resources:
         requests:
           memory: "256Mi"
           cpu: "250m"
         limits:
           memory: "512Mi"
           cpu: "500m"
       ```
     - Example (docker-compose):
       ```yaml
       deploy:
         resources:
           limits:
             cpus: '0.50'
             memory: 512M
       ```
   - **Lifecycle Policies:**
     - Idle timeout: Stop containers after X minutes of inactivity
     - Max lifetime: Auto-destroy containers after Y hours
     - Use Kubernetes Jobs/CronJobs or a cleanup service for enforcement
   - **Cleanup Procedures:**
     - Automated: Scheduled job scans for idle/expired containers and removes them
     - Manual: Admin dashboard for force cleanup
     - Log all cleanup actions for audit

3. **User Environment Use Case**
   - Each user gets a personal dev environment (e.g., VS Code server, JupyterLab, or custom Node app)
   - Containers are isolated and only accessible to the authenticated user
   - User data is stored in persistent storage (database or mounted volume)

4. **API Endpoints for Container Management**
   - `/api/containers` (POST: create/start, GET: status, DELETE: stop/destroy)
   - Secure endpoints with Auth0 JWT validation

---

## Phase 5: Database Design & Data Management

1. **Schema Proposal:**
   - **users**: id (PK), email (unique), auth0_id (unique), created_at
   - **sessions**: id (PK), user_id (FK), container_id, started_at, ended_at
   - **user_envs**: id (PK), user_id (FK), config (JSON), created_at, updated_at
   - **user_data**: id (PK), user_id (FK), data (JSONB), created_at, updated_at

2. **Data Models & Relationships:**
   - One user can have many sessions
   - One user has one environment config
   - One user can have multiple data records

3. **Migration Strategy:**
   - Use tools like Prisma Migrate, Knex, or Sequelize for schema migrations
   - Version migrations in source control
   - Run migrations automatically on deploy (CI/CD step)

4. **Backup & Restore:**
   - Implement regular database and volume backups
   - Document restore procedures

---

## Phase 6: Dashboard & User Experience

1. **User Dashboard**
   - `/dashboard` route (protected)
   - Show container status, tools, and environment info
   - Allow user to start/stop/restart their environment
   - Display logs, resource usage, and quick links to their environment

2. **Environment Customization**
   - Allow users to select tools/configurations for their environment
   - Store preferences in database
   - Pass preferences as env vars or config files to container

---

## Phase 7: Infrastructure & Orchestration

1. **Kubernetes Setup**
   - Write manifests for deployments, services, and persistent volumes
   - Use Helm for templating and environment overlays (dev/prod)
   - Deploy container manager and user environments as K8s pods
   - Set resource quotas and limits at namespace and pod level

2. **Traefik Configuration**
   - Set up Traefik as ingress controller
   - Configure dynamic routing to per-user containers
   - Enable automatic SSL (Let's Encrypt)
   - Add rate limiting and security middlewares

3. **Networking & Security**
   - Use Kubernetes network policies to isolate user pods
   - Ensure only Traefik can route to user containers
   - No direct public access to main app or database

---

## Phase 8: Error Handling, Monitoring, and DDoS Protection

1. **Error Handling Strategies**
   - Use try/catch in all API and container management logic
   - Return clear error messages to frontend (with user-friendly fallback text)
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors (e.g., container startup)
   - Notify users of failures and suggest next steps

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - If container creation fails, queue retry or offer fallback environment
   - If database is unavailable, show maintenance page
   - Use circuit breakers for critical dependencies

3. **Error Logging & Monitoring**
   - Use Winston, Pino, or similar for structured logging
   - Aggregate logs with ELK/EFK stack or cloud logging
   - Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for metrics
   - Alert on error spikes or critical failures

4. **DDoS Protection**
   - Use Cloudflare in front of Traefik for global DDoS protection
   - Enable Traefik rate limiting and IP whitelisting
   - Set up Kubernetes resource limits and network policies

5. **Brute Force Protection**
   - Rely on Auth0's built-in brute force and anomaly detection
   - Add rate limiting to login/register API endpoints
   - Enable MFA in Auth0 for extra security

---

## Phase 9: Cost Management & Scaling

1. **Cost Optimization Strategies**
   - Use Kubernetes resource quotas to cap usage per namespace/user
   - Prefer spot/preemptible nodes for non-critical workloads
   - Use container auto-scaling (HPA) based on CPU/memory
   - Pool idle containers for fast startup, destroy after timeout

2. **Resource Scaling Policies**
   - Set up Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for container manager
   - Use cluster autoscaler for node pool scaling
   - Monitor usage and adjust limits as needed

3. **Budget Controls**
   - Set up cloud provider budget alerts
   - Use dashboards to monitor spend and resource usage
   - Regularly review and optimize resource allocation

---

## Phase 10: Local Development & Testing

1. **docker-compose.yml for Local Dev**
   - Define services: frontend, user-container, db, traefik
   - Use named volumes for persistent data
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     version: '3.8'
     services:
       frontend:
         build: ./frontend
         ports:
           - "3000:3000"
         environment:
           - NODE_ENV=development
       user-container:
         image: user-env:latest
         environment:
           - USER_ID=dev
         deploy:
           resources:
             limits:
               cpus: '0.50'
               memory: 512M
       db:
         image: postgres:14-alpine
         environment:
           - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
           - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
           - POSTGRES_DB=peruser
         volumes:
           - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
       traefik:
         image: traefik:v2.5
         command:
           - "--providers.docker=true"
           - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
         ports:
           - "80:80"
         volumes:
           - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
     volumes:
       db_data:
     ```

2. **Development Environment Requirements**
   - Node.js (LTS), Docker, Docker Compose
   - kubectl, Helm (for K8s)
   - VS Code, Git, Docker extensions

3. **Local Testing Strategies**
   - Unit tests for API and business logic (Jest, Mocha)
   - Integration tests for API endpoints and container lifecycle
   - End-to-end tests (Cypress, Playwright) for user flows
   - Simulate container creation/cleanup in local dev

---

## Phase 11: CI/CD, Deployment, and Documentation

1. **Testing**
   - Write unit and integration tests for API and container logic
   - Test authentication and routing flows
   - Validate container isolation and resource limits

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions or similar for build, test, and deploy
   - Automate Docker image builds and K8s deployments

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to cloud Kubernetes cluster (GKE, EKS, AKS, etc.)
   - Point domain to Cloudflare, then to Traefik ingress
   - Monitor and validate production deployment

4. **Write Developer Documentation**
   - Setup, configuration, and deployment instructions
   - Architecture diagrams and flowcharts
   - Security and monitoring procedures

5. **User Documentation**
   - How to register, login, and use the personal environment
   - FAQ and troubleshooting
