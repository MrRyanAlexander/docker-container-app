# Build Plan: Per-User Containerized App with Next.js, Auth0, Kubernetes, and Traefik

## Overview
This document is a complete, step-by-step guide to building a modern, secure, and scalable web application where each authenticated user receives their own isolated Docker container environment. The stack includes:
- **Next.js** for the frontend and public routes
- **Auth0** for authentication
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- **Traefik** for routing and SSL
- **Docker** for per-user isolated environments
- **Cloudflare** for DDoS protection

The app will serve public pages statelessly and securely, and provide each user with a personal, persistent, and isolated environment (e.g., a dev workspace) after login.

## Phase 1: Project Initialization & Structure [Complete ✅]

1. **Directory Structure** ✅
   - [x] Create a root directory, e.g., `per-user-app/`
   - [x] Inside, create:
     - [x] `frontend/` (Next.js app)
     - [x] `kubernetes/` (K8s manifests)
     - [x] `helm/` (Helm charts) - *directory exists but empty*
     - [x] `traefik/` (Traefik config) - *directory exists but empty*
     - [x] `docker-compose.yml` (for local dev)

2. **Initialize Next.js App** ✅
   - [x] Run: `npx create-next-app@latest frontend --typescript --tailwind --eslint`

3. **Initialize Git Repository** ✅
   - [x] Run: `git init`
   - [x] Add a comprehensive `.gitignore` (Node, Docker, env files, editors, etc.)
   - [x] Make initial commit

4. **Development Environment Requirements** ✅
   - [x] Node.js (LTS)
   - [x] Docker Desktop (with Compose)
   - [x] kubectl, Helm (for K8s)
   - [x] Recommended: VS Code, Git, and Docker extensions

---

## Phase 2: Authentication & User Management [Complete ✅]

1. **Set Up Auth0** ✅
   - [x] Create an Auth0 tenant and application
   - [x] Configure callback URLs for local and production
   - [x] Store Auth0 credentials in environment variables

2. **Integrate Auth0 with Next.js** ✅
   - [x] Install `@auth0/auth0-react` and `next-auth`
   - [x] Implement `Auth0Provider` in `frontend/pages/_app.tsx`
   - [x] Create login, register, and logout flows
   - [x] Protect authenticated routes (e.g., `/dashboard`)

3. **User Session Management** ✅
   - [x] Use NextAuth.js for session handling
   - [x] Store user metadata (id, email, etc.) in session

---

## Phase 3: Public Pages & Routing [Complete ✅]

1. **Implement Public Pages** ✅
   - [x] `/` (Landing page with login/register buttons)
   - [x] `/login` (Login form) - *via Auth0*
   - [x] `/register` (Signup form) - *via Auth0*
   - [x] `/tos`, `/privacy`, `/forgot-password` (static info pages) - *tos and privacy implemented*

2. **Configure Next.js Routing** ✅

   - [x] User data is stored in persistent storage (database or mounted volume)

4. **API Endpoints for Container Management** ✅
